    <p>Shinjuku’s lucrative growth into one of the biggest cities in the world can be distinguished through its avant-garde cityscape. One building in particular representing Shinjuku, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, stands proudly in the bustling city. The government building comprises the main building, second building and parliament building. Although visiting a government institution could sound a bit tedious, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building proves to be an exciting institution with an impressive (and free!) observation deck and introductions of Tokyo and Japan’s local attractions.</p>

    <p>Ueno Park (上野公園, Ueno Kōen) is a large public park next to Ueno Station in central Tokyo. The park grounds were originally part of Kaneiji Temple, which used to be one of the city's largest and wealthiest temples and a family temple of the ruling Tokugawa clan during the Edo Period. Kaneiji stood in the northeast of the capital to protect the city from evil, much like Enryakuji Temple in Kyoto.</p>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Five-storied_Pagoda_-_Kan%27ei-ji.jpg" width="350">
    <p>Kaneiji is a Buddhist temple in a quiet residential area on the north side of Ueno Park which was once one of the most powerful and wealthy temples in Japan. Previously a massive temple complex with over 30 buildings, the modern Kaneiji Temple is much reduced in size from its historical peak when the temple grounds covered all of the area now occupied by Ueno Park and JR Ueno Station.</p>
